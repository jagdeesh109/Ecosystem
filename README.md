# Ecosystem
Balance food chain cycle by building micro ECOSYTEM.

# Description 
Initial Reference [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem). 

#Problem 
1. Currently there is unbalance in the Ecosytem. Which is dominated by human beings.
2. As the population is increasing, basic necessity are also increasing, amount of resource required to reach those needs are getting decreased.
3. ref video [Mercy For Animals](https://www.facebook.com/mercyforanimals/videos/10153522714214475/)

#solution 
1. Human always tends to leave in small community. These community design consist of animals,resources,shelters,tree. Currenlty shelter are small bulding,house.
2. when designing  community we take take ref [1] which will have its own food chain system. These system is called Micro ecosystem.
3. These micro system when intigrated with each other will have greater impact on global ecosystem.
4. Further these system are designed to adaptability. 

Based on the problem we will tend to have system. That will allow us to create the our own micro ecosystem.
